Summary:

  This submission contains the files:

    Makefile    -- the makefile
    Plan        -- a description of the design and operation of my code
    typescript  -- a sample run

    main.c      -- main entry point to the sttyl command

    sttyl.h     -- header files of the sttyl command, exposes the read_settings
                and write_settings functions 
    sttyl.c     -- contains the read_settings and write_settings functions
                also imports the table.h file

    tables.h    -- contains the data types and function definitions for all of 
                the functions used to perform the table lookups 
    tables.c    -- split into two sections, read tables/functions and write
                tables/functions.

Notes:
  Reading and writing tables were separated to make each implementation easier.
  For reads it's easier to have multiple tables since you just need to iterate
  over each struct and print whether it is ON or OFF.

  For writes, having a single table is easier because you can determine if a
  flag doesn't exist after you have finished iterating over the single table
  rather than checking five different tables
